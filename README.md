# **Go Pattern Generator Plugin** ðŸš€

_A plugin that makes your code cleaner, more maintainable, and keeps the demons of complexity at bay._

**"A good software system begins with great design principles, and that design is brought together by patterns. Patterns
are the reusable, proven solutions to recurring problems. They are the blueprints for building robust systems."_ â€“ Uncle
Bob (Robert C. Martin)**_

This is the **Go Pattern Generator Plugin** for IntelliJ IDEA. It exists to bring sanity to the chaotic world of
software design. You donâ€™t need to reinvent the wheel or drown in boilerplate. Instead, you press a button, and this
plugin does all the hard work for you. Patterns that adhere to **SOLID principles**â€”the undisputed backbone of good
object-oriented programmingâ€”are ready at your fingertips, just waiting to enhance your system.

---

## **What Makes Patterns Awesome (and Why You Should Care)**

**Design patterns** arenâ€™t just academic abstractions. Theyâ€™re the _wisdom of generations_ of developers, battle-tested
in countless projects. Theyâ€™re simple answers to common problems while making code extensible, readable, and
maintainable.

Yet, design patterns must be **implemented with discipline**. A pattern, done poorly, can lead to complexity. But a
pattern, crafted with care and adherence to **SOLID**, will set you free.

This plugin generates patterns in **Go**, fully aligned with **SOLID principles**, to help you conquer:

1. **Complexity** - Clean and modular code, ready for change.
2. **Change resistance** - Open to extension, closed to modification.
3. **Coupling** - Decoupling implementation from abstraction.

## **Supported Design Patterns**

Hereâ€™s a rundown of **every pattern** provided by this plugin. Each one serves a distinct purpose while aligning with
the **SOLID principles** you love and deserve!

---

### **Creational Patterns** â€“ _"Create things without chaos."_

**Purpose**: Focus on object creation while removing dependencies on concrete instantiations.

1. **Factory** (_Open/Closed Principle_):  
   Provides a flexible way to create objects without specifying their exact class. Generate factories that encode
   creation logic extending across multiple types.

2. **Abstract Factory** (_Dependency Inversion Principle_):  
   When one factory isnâ€™t enough. Produces families of related or dependent objects, guaranteeing that your dependencies
   use abstractions rather than concrete classes.

3. **Builder** (_Single Responsibility Principle_):  
   Helps you build complex objects step-by-step. When constructors become unreadable monstrosities, use the Builder to
   simplify creation and isolation of the assembly logic.

4. **Prototype** (_Liskov Substitution Principle_):  
   Create new objects by cloning existing ones. Nice and simple. Bonus: avoid the risks of running into constructors
   with too much responsibility.

5. **Singleton** (_Dependency Inversion Principle_):  
   A controlled, globally accessible single point of truth. It's thread-safe and lazy-loaded but still respects *
   *dependency injection** wherever possible.

---

### **Structural Patterns** â€“ _"Structure without breaking."_

**Purpose**: Compose objects into more powerful structures while keeping interfaces clean.

1. **Adapter** (_Liskov Substitution Principle_):  
   Converts one interface into another that clients expect, enabling systems to work together without modifications. A
   powerful tool for legacy code integration.

2. **Bridge** (_Open/Closed Principle_):  
   Separate abstraction from implementation, so they can evolve independently. Great for systems where you need to add
   new features without modifying unrelated abstractions.

3. **Composite** (_Liskov Substitution Principle_):  
   Compose objects into tree-like structures to represent part-whole hierarchies. This pattern ensures that individual
   objects and groups of objects are treated uniformly.

4. **Decorator** (_Open/Closed Principle_):  
   Add responsibilities to an object dynamically without modifying its code. Perfect when you need extensibility but
   canâ€™t afford to pollute the objectâ€™s inheritance hierarchy.

5. **Facade** (_Single Responsibility Principle_):  
   Simplify complex subsystems with a single unified interface. Itâ€™s your go-to for taming spaghetti-like subsystems.

6. **Proxy** (_Dependency Inversion Principle_):  
   Manage access to objects transparently using placeholders. Great for lazy initialization, access control, logging,
   and much more.

7. **Flyweight** (_Single Responsibility Principle_):  
   Reduce memory usage by sharing similar objects instead of creating new instances for identical data.

---

### **Behavioural Patterns** â€“ _"Behaviour without confusion."_

**Purpose**: Manage responsibility, interaction, and communication between objects.

1. **Strategy** (_Interface Segregation Principle_):  
   Encapsulate algorithms into interfaces, leaving you free to swap or add implementations. Clients use only what they
   need, no more and no less.

2. **Observer** (_Dependency Inversion Principle_):  
   Decouple subjects and observers to enable automatic notifications. Fantastic for event-driven systems or GUIs.

3. **Command** (_Open/Closed Principle_):  
   Encapsulate a request as a command object, making it easy to queue, log, or roll back operations.

4. **Template** (_Single Responsibility Principle_):  
   Define the skeleton of an algorithm, delegate specific steps to subclasses. Minimizes code duplication by reusing
   similar base processes.

5. **Chain of Responsibility** (_Single Responsibility Principle_):  
   Create a chain of handlers where each has one job: process or pass. A natural fit for middleware, request pipelines,
   or event handling.

6. **State** (_Open/Closed Principle_):  
   Encapsulate state-specific behavior into objects instead of bloating conditional logic. Add or modify valid states
   without touching the context or other states.

7. **Visitor** (_Open/Closed Principle_):  
   Add operations to complex object structures without modifying their classes. Particularly useful when traversing
   object hierarchies (e.g., ASTs).

8. **Iterator** (_Single Responsibility Principle_):  
   Iterates over aggregated data in an abstract manner. The collection handles iteration itself, keeping data
   encapsulated and your code clean.

9. **Mediator** (_Dependency Inversion Principle_):  
   Centralize communication between multiple objects, eliminating dependencies and keeping code decoupled.

10. **Memento** (_Single Responsibility Principle_):  
    Capture object state and allow it to be restored later. A great way to implement undo/redo functionality.

## **How to Use the Plugin**

1. **Install It**  
   Grab the **Go Pattern Generator Plugin** from the JetBrains Plugin Marketplace.

2. **Generate a Pattern**
    - Right-click in your project or folder, or use the IntelliJ `Generate` menu.
    - Select **Generate Go Pattern** and choose the one you need.

3. **Let It Work for You**
    - Modify the template as needed.
    - All generated code follows the **SOLID principles**. Your job? Flesh out the details.

4. **Enjoy**  
   Stand back and admire your clean design. Youâ€™ve avoided disaster.

## **A Word of Caution**

This plugin is awesome, but no plugin replaces **you**â€”the developer. Patterns are a powerful tool when used wisely. But
abuse them, and theyâ€™ll create complexity and confusion. So before generating anything, ask yourself:

- Does this pattern make sense for my problem?
- Is it solving real pain, or am I just using it for the sake of it?

Use patterns to create simplicity and never as a crutch. Keep your system clean, and your future self will thank you.

Happy coding,
